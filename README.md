# [Project 1 : Customer's Sentiment Analytic System](https://github.com/Ziem99/Sentisys) 
Merchants selling their products on the Web often ask their customers to review the products they have purchased and the associated services. As e-commerce is set in trend, the number of customer reviews that a product receives grows rapidly. For a popular product, the number of reviews can be in a hundred or even thousands. Therefore, from the merchants’ perspective, it is hard to get an overview from the abundance of text reviews which hinders them from making precise business decisions. This study aims to

* Find the sentiment of the customers’ review, whether it is positive, negative, or neutral 
* Find the frequency of the ratings for all models 
* Find the mean and standard deviation for the score and rating for all models. 

SentiSys is a system that collects the necessary information via a form and stores the information in its database. Then, SentiSys detects the sentiment of the customers’ review whether it is positive, negative, or neutral, and assigns a score to the reviews ranging from zero to one, where the higher the score, the more positive the score is. Finally, the data is visualized into easily understandable charts. There are in total four charts, all with their own purpose, in which it relates to our study objectives.

# [Project 2 : Income Census of American Population](https://github.com/Ziem99/Income-census-of-american-population)
The information of 32,562 adults in the United States of America (USA) from 1994 are analyzed in this research. Gender, age, race, working class, education level, income, and other factors are all included in this study's analysis. In order to develop a conclusion for this study, the trend and other key facts are noted.

According to this research, by studying the feature significance of the US adult income dataset, we hope to gain a better understanding of its relevance. Between the dependent and independent variables, exploratory analysis will be performed.

The goal of the research is to examine the information on the income census of the population of the United States of America, as well as crucial components that should be highlighted for the upcoming research.

This study aims to 

* To determine the level of income based on education level, working sectors & working hours per week.
