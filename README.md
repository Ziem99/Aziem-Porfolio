# Project 1 : Customer's Sentiment Analytic System
Merchants selling their products on the Web often ask their customers to review the products they have purchased and the associated services. As e-commerce is set in trend, the number of customer reviews that a product receives grows rapidly. For a popular product, the number of reviews can be in a hundred or even thousands. Therefore, from the merchants’ perspective, it is hard to get an overview from the abundance of text reviews which hinders them from making precise business decisions. This study aims to

* find the sentiment of the customers’ review, whether it is positive, negative, or neutral 
* find the frequency of the ratings for all models 
* find the mean and standard deviation for the score and rating for all models. 

SentiSys is a system that collects the necessary information via a form and stores the information in its database. Then, SentiSys detects the sentiment of the customers’ review whether it is positive, negative, or neutral, and assigns a score to the reviews ranging from zero to one, where the higher the score, the more positive the score is. Finally, the data is visualized into easily understandable charts. There are in total four charts, all with their own purpose, in which it relates to our study objectives.
